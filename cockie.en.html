Welcome to Activision's Cookie Policy. This Cookie Policy was last updated on October 28, 2019.

Cookies & Similar Technologies
Activision uses cookies, advertising IDs and/or similar technologies on the Properties (collectively referred to as "Cookies"). A "Cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that many websites and other online products and services often store on a user's computer or device in order to identify it and associate activity with it. Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster and easier by letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and generally improving your experience of a website. For example, we use Cookies when you login to your Activision account to keep you logged in so that every time you move to a new page on our website you do not have to reenter your login details. On mobile, we use your mobile device advertising ID. Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple's ID for advertising (the ‘IDFA’), which are uniquely associated with your mobile device. 

For more information about our use of technologies that are similar to cookies, and your opt-out choices, please see the Similar Technologies section under Types of Cookies below.

This Cookie Policy explains how Activision uses "Cookies". Activision may collect both personal and non-personal information from you when you use Activision websites, products and services ("Properties"). For more information on how Activision collects, stores, uses and may transfer or disclose your information, please see our Privacy Policy.

When visiting the Properties you can learn more about the types of Cookies collected and change your Cookie settings at any time by clicking the “Cookie Settings” link in the footer of our websites or viewing the Cookies List below. We use Cookies to optimize your visit, make your browsing and/or user experience as effective as possible, and let you know about offers and features that we think will interest you. This means that if you disallow Cookies, your use of the Properties may be impaired
